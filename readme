Used for keeping snipets of drills/exercise of mine
while reading "Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++" by Bjarne Stroustrup
Also a good playground for learning vim.
Mac/linux terminals will do fine. For windows it's best to use mingw terminal.

Compiled by hand using c/c++ compilers:
`c++ build/[program_name] -o [source_file_name]`
and then run:
`./build/[program_name]`

Reasons: IDE's tend to eat too much memory and take forever to start on my quite old hardware

TOOD:
- compile and run an assembly program with nasm + proper terminal output
- learn how to use gnu debugger from terminal
- learn basic single file vim commands
- learn basic multifile vim commands
- learn how to link 3-rd party libraries through bash
- look into build tools like cmake to simplify the work (and fun!) from termianl
